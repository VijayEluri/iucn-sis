<p>This is the basis of the GoGoEgo representation framework.  All 
publicly-accessible resources should return GoGoEgoRepresentations.  
If your resources do not return these, they will likely be automatically 
converted which may not be what you want in many cases.<p>
<p>There are two sometimes separate, but equal, parts to representations.  
First, the representation itself contains all the functionality available 
for use in server-parsed scripts and expression language.  Second, the 
Trap is essentially the interface that is used atop this representation.  
It is possible that the Representation and the Trap are one in the same, 
but you can use the trap to restrict functionality and track when your 
representation is touched by a script.</p>
