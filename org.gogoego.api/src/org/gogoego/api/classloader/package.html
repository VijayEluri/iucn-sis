The Classloader framework provides support for OSGi plugins that are 
simply static assets.  For example, if you have a project that contains 
HTML or script files that you want to be able to access via an application, 
you can use this framework to allow them to be accessible as plugins.  This 
is very useful for serving compiled GWT projects.
