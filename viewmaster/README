VIEWMASTER FOR BAIJI

This is an experimental, standalone workspace using latest
dbsession bits.

It creates a full set of denormalized, updateable views on a copy of
Baiji.  The Baiji database needs to be loaded with a copy of the
"universe" table included here as a CSV, and it would be very helpful
to create the following indexes for performance:

create index field_assessmentid on field (assessmentid);
create index primitive_field_fieldid on primitive_field (fieldid);

The views are named vw_(field) where each table is an aggregation of
the primitives composing the field.

The views are also constructed to show only those assessments
identified in a manually created vw_filter table.  If vw_filter
does not exist, the scripts will fail.

A nice way to run this is within Eclipse using the OSGi Framework
target.
